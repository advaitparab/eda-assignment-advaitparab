# Exploratory Data Analysis - Assignment

## üîç Overview
This lab is designed to help you practice exploratory data analysis using Python. You will work with some housing data for the state of California. You will use various data visualization and analysis techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in the data, and clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis. The lab is divided into the following sections:

- Data Loading and Preparation
- Data Visualization
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (using visualizations)

## üéØ Objectives
This assignment assess your ability to:
- Load and pre-process data using `pandas`
- Clean data and preparing it for analysis
- Use visualization techniques to explore and understand the data
- Use visualization techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data
- Use visualization to derive insights from the data
- Apply basic statistical analysis to derive insights from the data
- Communicate your findings through clear and effective data visualizations and summaries

## üìù Instructions
### 0.Setup
- Accept the assignment on GitHub Classroom. (looks like you've already done that)
  - This repository is private; only you and the instructors can see it. Please don't change the visibility of the repository in the settings.
- Clone the repository to your computer.
  - You can use GitHub Desktop, the command line, or VSCode to do that.
  - You can view the ["Cloning a Repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=webui) for more information.
- Open the assignment root folder in VSCode.
  - If you get a notification asking you to install the recommended extensions, go ahead and do that.
- using the terminal, install the dependencies for this project:
  - if you're using `poetry`, run `poetry install`.
  - If you're using `pipenv`, run `pipenv install`
  - if you're using `pip`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open the `notebook.ipynb` Notebook in VSCode
- Make sure you have the right kernel selected for the notebook. Use this [guide](https://it4063c.github.io/guides/FAQ/vscode-jupyter) if you need help.

### 1. Complete the exercises
The notebook itself will guide you through the exercises. You'll find instructions regarding each exercise in the notebook.
You'll also find some tips and links to documentations that will help you complete the exercises.

- Make sure you commit often, you'll find this emoji üö©, signifying suggested spots where you can make a commit of your code.
- Don't forget to push your code to GitHub when you're done.
- If you're doing this assignment, over multiple sessions, make sure you always push your code to GitHub before you close your computer to avoid losing your work.

### 2. Finalize and Submit your Work
- **Once you've completed all the exercises, come back to this file** and complete the reflection section and the self-evaluation section at the end of this file.
- Submit your work by submitting a link to your repository on Canvas.

# üí≠ Reflection and Self Assessment

**I learned:** (repeat as needed)
- How to handle missing data using pandas.
- The importance of visualizing data distributions to make informed decisions.

**I struggled with:** (repeat as needed)
- Understanding the difference between mean, median, and trimmed mean for imputation.
- Deciding when to drop rows versus imputing missing values.

**I need the instructor to help me with:** (repeat as needed)
- Interpreting correlation matrices and scatter plots effectively.
- Best practices for handling outliers in datasets.

**How long did it take you to complete this assignment? and reflect on that**
6 hours.

**How often did you have to check the solution to the problem? How do you feel about that?**
- I referred to the solutions a few times, especially for syntax-related issues. I feel it was helpful but would like to rely less on them in the future.

**If I were to do this assignment again, I would:** (repeat as needed)
- Spend more time exploring the dataset before starting the tasks.
- Try alternative methods for imputing missing data and compare results.

**üíØ Self Grade:** For this assignment, based on my work and my reflections I should get [20] out of 20.
