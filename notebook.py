# # Exploratory Data Analysis - Assignment
# 
# ## 🔍 Overview
# This lab is designed to help you practice exploratory data analysis using Python. You will work with some housing data for the state of California. You will use various data visualization and analysis techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in the data, and clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis. The lab is divided into the following sections:
# 
# - Data Loading and Preparation
# - Data Visualization
# - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (using visualizations)
# 
# ## 🎯 Objectives
# This assignment assess your ability to:
# - Load and pre-process data using `pandas`
# - Clean data and preparing it for analysis
# - Use visualization techniques to explore and understand the data
# - Use visualization techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data
# - Use visualization to derive insights from the data
# - Apply basic statistical analysis to derive insights from the data
# - Communicate your findings through clear and effective data visualizations and summaries

# #### Package Imports
# We will keep coming back to this cell to add "import" statements, and configure libraries as we need

# In[1]:


# Common imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import trim_mean

# To plot figures
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# #### 5.3: Visualize the location of the houses using a scatter plot
# In a single figure, plot a scatter plot of the `longitude` and `latitude` columns. 
# 
# 
# Try this twice, once setting the `alpha` parameter to set the transparency of the points to 0.1, and once without setting the `alpha` parameter.

# In[11]:


# 💻 scatter plat without alpha


# In[12]:


# 💻 scatter plat with alpha

# #### 8.2: show a sample of 5 records of the rows with missing data
# Notice there are 2 keywords here: `sample` and (rows with missing data)
# 
# <details>
#   <summary>🦉 Hints:</summary>
# 
#   * You'll do pandas filtering here
#   * You'll need to use the `isna()` or `isnull()` method on the 1 feature with missing data. to find the rows with missing data
#   * you'll need to use the `sample()` method to get a sample of 5 records of the results
# </details>

# In[21]:


# 💻 use Pandas Filtering to show all the records with missing `total_bedrooms` field


# #### 8.3: Calculate the central tendency values of the missing data feature
# * Calculate the mean, median, trimmed mean

# In[22]:


# 💻 get the mean, median and trimmed mean of the total_bedrooms column
total_bedrooms_median = 0
total_berooms_mean = 0
total_bedrooms_trimmed_mean = 0

print(f"Median: {total_bedrooms_median}")
print(f"Mean: {total_berooms_mean}")
print(f"Trimmed Mean: {total_bedrooms_trimmed_mean}")


# #### 8.4: Visualize the distribution of the missing data feature
# * Plot a histogram of the missing data feature (total_bedrooms)

# In[23]:


# 💻 Plot the histogram of the total_bedrooms column


# #### 8.5: Choose one of the central tendency values and use it to fill in the missing data
# * Justify your choice
# * Don't use the `inplace` parameter, instead, create a new dataframe with the updated values. (this is a bit challenging)
# * show the first 5 records of the new dataframe to confirm we got the full dataframe
# 
# [📜 You should find a good example here](https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/pandas-fillna/#example-2)

# In[24]:


# 💻 Fill the missing values in the total_bedrooms column with an appropriate value, then show the first 5 records of the new dataframe


# ❓ Why did you choose this value?
💻
# #### 8.6: Confirm that there are no more missing values in the new dataframe
# * make sure the dataframe contains all features, not just the `total_bedrooms` feature

# In[25]:


# 💻 Confirm the new dataframe has no missing values


# #### 8.7: Dropping the missing data
# assume we didn't want to impute the missing data, and instead, we wanted to drop the rows with missing data.
# * don't use the `inplace` parameter, instead, create a new dataframe with the updated values.

# In[26]:


# 💻 drop the missing rows of the total_bedroom and save it to a new dataframe


# #### 8.8: Confirm that there are no more missing values in the new dataframe
# * make sure the dataframe contains all features, not just the `total_bedrooms` feature

# In[27]:


# 💻 Confirm the new dataframe has no missing values
